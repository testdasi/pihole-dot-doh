# For Strict use        GETDNS_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED

# Set to 1 to instruct stubby to distribute queries across all available name
# servers - this will use multiple simultaneous connections which can give
# better performance is most (but not all) cases.

# upstream until it becomes unavailable, then use the next one.

# Specify the list of upstream recursive name servers to send queries to
# In Strict mode upstreams need either a tls_auth_name or a tls_pubkey_pinset
# so the upstream can be authenticated.
# The information for an upstream can include the following:
# - address_data: IPv4 or IPv6 address of the upstream
#   port: Port for UDP/TCP (default is 53)
#   tls_auth_name: Authentication domain name checked against the server
#                  certificate
#   tls_pubkey_pinset: An SPKI pinset verified against the keys in the server
#                      certificate
#     - digest: Only "sha256" is currently supported
#       value: Base64 encoded value of the sha256 fingerprint of the public

#   tls_port: Port for TLS (default is 853)
